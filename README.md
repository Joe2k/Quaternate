# :handshake: Quaternate

Quaternate is an app to support multidimensional collaborative environment among a group of people!

## :tada: Features

- People can simultaneously have a video/audio call while texting each other, and can also doodle and draw their ideas out... all in the same page :exploding_head:.
- This app is specially beneficial when you want to brainstorm ideas, because currently one has to switch between many apps to do so, while all this can be done in Quaternate's cubicles with only a scroll!
- This whole app was built during a 3-day hackathon at IIT, Hyderabad,2021 on the theme "Social Interaction Through Remote Means" which we went on to win the [1st Place](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gGMKv-1iQhn7COG3FAjXyy48ns1aEwTW/view?usp=sharing).
